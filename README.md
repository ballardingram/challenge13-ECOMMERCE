## Contributions
This was largely an independent project that relied heavily on documentation, trial and error, and the challenge documentation. I referenced the U-DEVELOP-IT activity a lot to get the routes correct. My tutor also was a tremendous help reassuring me that I was not getting logic wrong, it was a syntax issue when Insomnia returned an empty array.. Huge kudos to her for this.

## Observations and Challenges
Getting the routes and models correct was actually much easier than I thought. I was surprised at how much I knew just based on what I remembered from the lesson. It was then about testing my routes once I got Insomnia up and the database connected. That pesky 400 error means something is wrong, but since it points to starter code, I just left it.
